Created by Patrick Stumps

GenomeAnalyzer was created to analyze GC content and codon frequency of an input fasta file. CompareGenomes performs the same function,
however it compares two input genomes using the log2 ratio. If you would like to see a demonstration of the program, run the 
'run.sh' bash script in the demo folder. If you would like to use this for your own data, its usage is as follows and will print output to
STDOUT:

Input: python3 [inputfile]
